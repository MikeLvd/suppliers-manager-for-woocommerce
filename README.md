## API Reference

### Functions

```php
// Get all suppliers for a product
$relationships = new \Suppliers_Manager_For_WooCommerce\Supplier_Relationships();
$supplier_ids = $relationships->get_product_suppliers($product_id);

// Get primary supplier
$primary_id = $relationships->get_primary_supplier($product_id);

// Get all products for a supplier
$product_ids = $relationships->get_supplier_products($supplier_id);

// Add relationship
$relationships->add_relationship($product_id, $supplier_id, $is_primary);

// Update all suppliers for a product
$relationships->update_product_suppliers($product_id, $supplier_ids, $primary_id);
```

### Hooks & Filters

All v2.x hooks maintained plus new ones:

```php
// CPT-specific hooks
do_action('smfw_supplier_created', $supplier_id);
do_action('smfw_supplier_updated', $supplier_id);
do_action('smfw_relationship_added', $product_id, $supplier_id);

```

## Migration Troubleshooting

### Check Migration Status

```php
// Get migration stats
$stats = get_option('smfw_migration_stats');
print_r($stats);
```

### Manual Migration Verification

3. Check a few suppliers have correct data
4. Edit a product and verify suppliers are assigned

### Re-run Migration (if needed)

```php
// In wp-admin/plugins.php
// Deactivate and reactivate plugin
// Migration runs again if taxonomy data exists
```

### Check Logs

```php
// WooCommerce > Status > Logs
// Look for 'suppliers-manager-migration' log
```
